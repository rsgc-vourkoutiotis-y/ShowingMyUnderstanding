 # Conditionals - Practice
 
 How can conditionals be used to create output?
 
 Create an image where the characteristics depend on the result of the random number generation.
 
 When the random number is 0, the fill for the shape is empty.
 
 When the random number is 1, the fill for the shape is black.
 
 Try creating this image for practice.
